# ms-transcriber
A musescore plugin that assists you in transcribing music

Play selected music directly in musescore, so you don't have to switch to an external music player while transcribing that music.
Right now this plugin doesn't do any sophisticated stuff.
You just can play/pause a track and seek forwards an backbards.

## Dependencies

- QtMultimedia, which isn't contained in MuseScore by default
